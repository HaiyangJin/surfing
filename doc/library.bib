  title		= {Smoothing and cluster thresholding for cortical
		  surface-based group analysis of fMRI data},
  abstract	= {Cortical surface-based analysis of fMRI data has proven to
		  be a useful method with several advantages over
		  3-dimensional volumetric analyses. Many of the statistical
		  methods used in 3D analyses can be adapted for use with
		  surface-based analyses. Operating within the framework of
		  the FreeSurfer soft-ware package, we have implemented a
		  surface-based version of the cluster size exclusion method
		  used for multiple comparisons correction. Furthermore, we
		  have a developed a new method for generating regions of
		  interest on the cortical surface using a sliding threshold
		  of cluster exclusion followed by cluster growth. Cluster
		  size limits for multiple probability thresholds were
		  estimated using random field theory and validated with
		  Monte Carlo simulation. A prerequisite of RFT or cluster
		  size simulation is an estimate of the smoothness of the
		  data. In order to estimate the intrinsic smoothness of
		  group analysis statistics, independent of true activations,
		  we conducted a group analysis of simulated noise data sets.
		  Because smoothing on a cortical surface mesh is typically
		  implemented using an iterative method, rather than directly
		  applying a Gaussian blurring kernel, it is also necessary
		  to determine the width of the equivalent Gaussian blurring
		  kernel as a function of smoothing steps. Iterative
		  smoothing has previously been modeled as continuous heat
		  diffusion, providing a theoretical basis for predicting the
		  equivalent kernel width, but the predictions of the model
		  were not empirically tested. We generated an empirical heat
		  diffusion kernel width function by performing surface-based
		  smoothing simulations and found a large disparity between
		  the expected and actual kernel widths. (c) 2006 Elsevier

		  neuroscientists with huge amounts of multivariate data. The
		  complexity of the data creates a need for statistical
		  summary, but the local averaging standardly applied to this
		  end may obscure the effects of greatest neuroscientific

		  analysis has focused on the discovery of activation, i.e.,
		  of extended brain regions whose average activity changes
		  across experimental conditions. Here we propose to ask a
		  more general question of the data: Where in the brain does
		  the activity pattern contain information about the

		  propose scanning the imaged volume with a "searchlight,"
		  whose contents are analyzed multivariately at each location
