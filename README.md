Surfing
=======
Surfing is a Matlab toolbox for surface-based voxel neighborhood selection on the cerebral cortex, intended for informationg mapping of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. 

Features
--------
- voxel selection based on cortical surface reconstruction.
- support for Euclidian, Dijkstra and geodesic distance metrics.
- selection of voxels across the brain based on either a fixed radius or a fixed number of voxels.
- support for twin surfaces (FreeSurfer; pial and white) and single surfaces (Caret and BrainVoyager).

Non-features
------------
- no GUI: commands are entered in the Matlab command window, or in a matlab script.
- no full processing pipeline: preprocessing, surface reconstruction, classification, statistical analyses, and visualization are not part of the toolbox. Many other programs can be used for this, for example FSL, AFNI, SPM for preprocessing and regression; Freesurfer and Caret for surface reconstruction; several online toolboxes for classification and statistical analyses; and AFNI, Freesurfer and Caret for visualization. 

Requirements
------------
- A working installation of Matlab
- For geodesic distance metrics a working mex compiler environment may be required
- GIFTI surfaces require the GIFTI matlab toolbox: http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/gifti
- BrainVoyager surfaces require Neuroelf: neuroelf.net
- AFNI NIML I/O requires the AFNI matlab toolbox: http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/matlab/

Quick start
-----------
- add the "surfing", "misc" and "toolbox_fast_marching" directories (and their subdirectories) to the Matlab path.
- run "compile_mex" in the "surfing" root directory.
- view the surfing_voxelselection.m function, or consider the examples in the "examples" directory.
